# BSE49

This is a benchmark and reference set for bond separation energies. The reference level and the rest of the computational details are described in the article:

[Prasad et al., _BSE49, a diverse, high-quality benchmark dataset of separation energies of chemical bonds_, Sci. Data *8*, 300 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-01088-2)

Note: the `mapping_old_to_new.txt` file contains the remapping of the
BSE49 names after the correction in which 108 duplicated entries were
removed. This file is only for the purpose of renaming files if you
started using the BSE49 set before the correction.
